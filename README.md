Hey everyone , I am Rudransh Awasthi aka Jack Higar . I build fronti as you know if you have see my fronti 1st version repo but if you dont so I actually build it as image to code app I buyed fronti.tech domain on
31 december 2024 for 250 inr or something and launched fronti THE IMAGE TO CODE AT  13 jan 2025 . So one day I was siting at my roon thinking about fronti and something that could build desktop apps , mobile apps and
web apps at one place . And a thought strike in mind why not we pivot fronti to a universal app builder and these are very 1st version code of fronti THE universal app builder , It also have fronti 1st ever logo I 
ever made for fronti . This can sound crazy to some , stupid to some and genius to some but we are not here to judge . This was code by a 13 year old and launched at march 17 2025 .
You can freely use code where ever you want .

THANKYOU UTKARSH TO BE WITH ME IN THIS PERFECT ADVENTURE .
I WANT TO THANK MY PARENTS TO TRUST ME , GIVE ME A LAPTOP AND GROW ME UP TO THINK AND DO THINGS I LOVE TO DO. 
THANKS UNIVERSE AND ENTHROPHY .
